NAME
    Session - Object Oriented wrapper around Apache::Session to avoid its
    tie mechanism

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple wrapper around Apache::Session without the "tie"
    interface. Tie is too slow for web applications (think mod_perl) and you
    may prefere a standard OO API instead of a poor tie interface (I hate
    tie).

    You should look for Apache::Session and Apache::Session::Flex man page
    for more details on the session management. We will explain here only
    things that differs from Apache::Session.

    Note that neither Apache::Session nor Session are liked with mod_perl,
    you should use Session in any programs for the web or not.
